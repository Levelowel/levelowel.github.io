Complementary is a Minecraft Java Edition shader pack based on Capt Tatsu's **"BSL Shaders"**. The goal of Complementary is being good at everything. Performance, gameplay, beauty, compatibility; you name it. Complementary will try to provide you the most issueless experience possible within the limitations of Optifine's shader pipeline. It runs reasonably fast, supports all GPUs and drivers, works well with mods that no one thought a shader pack could be compatible with, fixes problems that no other shader packs adressed before, doesn't disturb you with excessive effects, and most importantly, it looks good according to the users. If you're wondering about what's changed over BSL, you can check out the complete changelog from BSL to Complementary [here.](https://justpaste.it/2z91q)
###⠀
Note that Complementary isn't installed the exact same way as other shaders. So it's recommended that you read the installation.
