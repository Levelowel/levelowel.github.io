# Note: This only applies if you are NOT using any big mods AND you are playing in Minecraft 1.13.2 or higher!
## 1. Download and install OptiFine
### 1. Run Minecraft at least once on the version you want to use.
- This is to ensure that the launcher downloads all of the files required to install OptiFine.

### 2. Make sure the Minecraft launcher is closed before proceeding.
- That will save you a lot of trouble!

### 3. Download and install Java if it is not already installed on your system.
- Minecraft's bundled Java does NOT count.
- Download Java [here.](https://www.java.com/download/)

### 4. Download OptiFine and open it with Java.
- Download OptiFine [here.](https://optifine.net/downloads)
- Please note that you will be temporarily forwarded to an Adfly page unless you use the "Mirror" link. **On this page, just click the "Skip Ad" button in the top right corner.**
- If the website takes you to a blank page, disable your ad blocker. In some rare cases, you may need to disable your antivirus as well.
- Your browser will likely tell you, "This file could damage your computer. Do you want to continue?" This is normal and most browsers will simply tell you that because OptiFine comes as a JAR file, which is a Java executable file.
- If the file is opened as a ZIP archive or you have another problem starting the OptiFine installer, use [Jarfix.](Https://johann.loefflmann.net/de/software/jarfix/index.html) 

### 5. Make sure the installation directory points to your `.minecraft` folder before clicking "Install".

### 6. You should now see a new "OptiFine" profile in the official Minecraft launcher.
- If the launcher does not automatically create a profile, you may need to [create a profile yourself.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_launcher#Installations)

## 2. Download and install Complementary Shaders
### 1. Download Complementary Shaders
- Go to [this page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders/files) and click the "Download" button.

### 2. Unpack Complementary Shaders
- Right-click the "Complementary_v3.XX_\[UNZIP_ME]\" file that you downloaded from there, click "Extract All..." and then click "Extract".
- You now have a folder with two zipped folders and a text document. For now, leave the window open and don't unzip them unless you really know what you're doing!

### 3. Install Complementary Shaders
- Start Minecraft with OptiFine, navigate to "Options..." -> "Resource Packs..." and click on "Open Pack Folder". A new window opens into which you have to move the "ComplementaryResources 3.XX". You can close this window when you're done.
- Alternatively, you can drag and drop the "ComplementaryResources 3.XX" into the "Select Resource Packs" screen and confirm with "Yes".
- Select "ComplementaryResources 3.XX.zip" by clicking the arrow on the icon when you hover over the file and click "Done".
- Navigate to "Options..." -> "Video Settings..." -> "Shaders..." and click on "Shader Folder". A new window opens into which you have to move the "ComplementaryShaders 3.XX".
- Select "ComplementaryShaders_3.XX.zip" and press "Done".
- If you want to change any of the shader options, go to "Shaders..." again and click on "Shader Options..." in the lower right corner.

## Now you can enjoy your enhanced Minecraft experience!
