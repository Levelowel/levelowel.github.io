## 1. Downloading & Installing OptiFine
### 1. Run Minecraft on the version you'd like to use at LEAST once.
- This is to ensure the launcher downloads all the necessary files for OptiFine to be installed.

### 2. Make sure the Minecraft launcher is closed before proceeding.
- This will save you a LOT of hassle!

### 3. Download and install Java, if it is not already installed on your system.
- Minecraft's bundled Java does NOT count.
- Download Java [here.](https://www.java.com/download/)

### 4. Download OptiFine, and open it with Java.
- Download OptiFine [here.](https://optifine.net/downloads)
- Note that, unless you're using the "mirror" link, this will temporarily bring you to an adfly page. **Do not click on anything on this page apart from the "Skip Ad" button in the top right corner.**
- If the website leads you to an empty page, disable your adblocker. In some rare cases, you may need to also disable your antivirus.
- Your browser will likely tell you something along the lines of "This file could harm your computer, do you want to proceed?" This is normal, and most browsers will tell you this simply because OptiFine comes as a .jar file, which is a Java executable.
- If the file shows as a ZIP archive, or you have any other issue trying to open the OptiFine installer, try using [Jarfix.](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html)

### 5. Ensure the install directory points to your `.minecraft` folder before clicking "Install"

### 6. You should now see a new "OptiFine" profile in the official Minecraft launcher.
- If no profile is created in the launcher automatically, you may need to [create one yourself.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_launcher#Installations)

## 2. Downloading & Installing Complementary Shaders
### 1. Download Complementary Shaders
- Go to [this page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders/files) and click the "Download" button.

### 2. Unpack Complementary Shaders
- Right-click the "Complementary_v3.XX_\[UNZIP_ME]\" file that you downloaded from there, click "Extract All..." and then click "Extract".
- You now have a folder with two zipped folders and a text document. For now, leave the window open and don't unzip it unless you really know what you're doing!

### 3. Install Complementary Shaders
- Start Minecraft with OptiFine, navigate to "Options..." -> "Resource Packs..." and click on "Open Pack Folder". A new window opens into which you have to move the "ComplementaryResources 3.XX". You can close this window when you're done.
- Alternatively, you can drag and drop the "ComplementaryResources 3.XX" into the "Select Resource Packs" screen and confirm with "Yes".
- Select "ComplementaryResources 3.XX.zip" by clicking the arrow on the icon when you hover over the file and click "Done".
- Navigate to "Options..." -> "Video Settings..." -> "Shaders..." and click on "Shader Folder". A new window opens into which you have to move the "ComplementaryShaders 3.XX.zip".
- Select "ComplementaryShaders_3.XX.zip" and press "Done".
- If you want to change any of the shader settings, go to "Shaders..." again and click on "Shader Options..." in the lower right corner.
