### 1. Run Minecraft on the version you'd like to use at LEAST once.
- This is to ensure the launcher downloads all the necessary files for OptiFine to be installed.
### 2. Make sure the Minecraft launcher is closed before proceeding.
- This will save you a LOT of hassle!
### 3. Download and install Java, if it is not already installed on your system.
- Minecraft's bundled Java does NOT count.
- Download Java here: https://www.java.com/download/
### 4. Download OptiFine, and open it with Java.
- Download OptiFine here: https://optifine.net/downloads
- Note that, unless you're using the "mirror" link, this will temporarily bring you to an adfly page. **Do not click on anything on this page apart from the "Skip Ad" button in the top right corner.
- If the website leads you to an empty page, disable your adblocker. In some rare cases, you may need to also disable your antivirus.
- Your browser will likely tell you something along the lines of "This file could harm your computer, do you want to proceed?" This is normal, and most browsers will tell you this simply because OptiFine comes as a .jar file, which is a Java executable.
- If the file sho Vws as a ZIP archive, or you have any other issue trying to open the OptiFine installer, try using Jarfix: https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/index.html
### 5. Ensure the install directory points to your .minecraft folder before clicking "Install"
